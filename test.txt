Too much of the past for one to memorize
Too many words remained for one to read through the lines
The ebb and flow of the crowd, floods the world and paradise
Along the path of time

Every night brings a dream, but the day relentlessly keeps me awake
All the rest will be torn up whenever a choice is made
Every living soul in the fray, striving for their own safe place
Life is too long to end at grave

Just a drop of water suffices
Encompassed, and swallowed through space by the universe
Back to the source
Gone are those years living for a reason
Here it comes, the moment of the scene of lost and found

Personas played out on the stage
Will return to the self when there's a curtain call

Every night brings a dream, but the day relentlessly keeps me awake
All the rest will be torn up whenever a choice is made
Everyone has their own desire leading to the ultimate
Life is too long to end at a grave

Just a drop of water suffices
Still, I wish to embrace the world with my thoughts
A eulogy
Time to leave where I have stood so long
Letting you go recover traces overlapped
Ends, then begins
